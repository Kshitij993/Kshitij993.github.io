  <p>
    JAVA has become enormously popular over time and has remained in most of the surveys among top three popular programming
    languages over two decades. This popularity of JAVA, and its acceptance can be attributed to its features and design. As
    stated in the Java language white paper by Sun, Java is simple, object-oriented, distributed, interpreted, robust,
    secure, architecture-neutral, portable, high-performance, multithreaded, and dynamic. Let’s analyze these often-used
    buzzwords.
    <div style="padding-left: 300px;"><img src="./bin/images/img1.jpg" height="350px"></div>
    <h3 id="pt2">Simple:</h3>
    <p>Java is very simple to learn with quite clean and easily understandable syntax. It is based on C++ programming
    language(hence easier to switch from C++) . Many complicated but rarely used concepts like operator overloading and
    explicit pointers, etc, has been removed from Java. It provides Automatic Garbage Collection in Java hence no need to
    remove unreferenced objects. These are some of the features that makes Java, a simple programming language.</p>
    <h3 id="pt3">Object-oriented:</h3>
    <p>Java is a pure object oriented programming language. Without class concept, not a single a program can be written in
    Java. Organizing software in combination of different types of objects that incorporates data as well as well as
    behaviour is object-oriented. The methodology of object oriented programming language(OOPs), simplifies the development
    and maintenance of software by providing some rules.
    Basic concepts of OOPs are:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
      <li>Object</li>
      <li>Class</li>
      <li>Polymorphism</li>
      <li>Abstraction</li>
      <li>Encapsulation</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="padding-left: 100px;"><img src="./bin/images/img4.png" height="300px"></div>
    <h3 id="pt4">Platform Independent:</h3>
    <p>Java provides WORA(write once run anywhere) feature. Java is a platform independent programming language as it is
    different from other languages like C,C++, etc, which are compiled into platform specific machines. This platform can be
    the hardware or software environment where the program runs. Java itself provides-platform based platform. This
    software-based platform runs on top of other hardware-based platforms. Its components are Java Runtime Environment and
    Application Programming Interface(API). Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into bytecode which is then
    converted into machine language and hence this enables it to run on run on multiple platforms, for example, Windows,
    Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc.</p>
    <h3 id="pt5">Security:</h3>
    <p>Java is known very well for the security it provides. Virus free system can be developed. It is secure as:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
      <li>The concept of explicit pointer is not there.</li>
      <li>Classloader is a part of JRE which is used to load classes into the JVM dynamically, which adds security by separating
      the package for the classes of the local file system from those that are imported from network sources.</li>
      <li>It runs inside a virtual machine sandbox which servers as a protective cover.</li>
      <li>There is bytecode verier that looks for illegal code that is potential voilater of access right to objects.</li>
      <li>Security manager that keeps tab on the resources that can be accessed by a class.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some security can also be provided by an application developer explicitly through SSL, JAAS, Cryptography, etc.</p>
    <h3 id="pt6">Robust:</h3>
    <p>Java is strong or robust as:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
      <li>It uses strong memory management.</li>
      <li>There is automatic garbage collection in java which runs on the Java Virtual Machine to get rid of objects which are not
      being used by a Java application anymore.</li>
      <li>There are exception handling and the type checking mechanism in Java. All these points make Java robust.</li>
      <li>There is bytecode verier that looks for illegal code that is potential voilater of access right to objects.</li>
      <li>There is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems and make usability simpler.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="pt7">Portable:</h3>
    <p>The property of platform independence facilitated by WORA property provides java with the feature of high portability.
    It facilitates us to carry the Java bytecode to any platform.</p>
    <h3>Architecture-neutral:</h3>
    <p>Java is architecture neutral because there are no implementation dependent features, for example, the size of primitive
    types is fixed. In C programming, int data type occupies 2 bytes of memory for 32-bit architecture and 4 bytes of memory
    for 64-bit architecture. However, it occupies 4 bytes of memory for both 32 and 64-bit architectures in Java.</p>
    <h3 id="pt8">Compiled and Interpreted language:</h3>
    <p>Java is considered to be both a compiled and an interpreted language because its source code is first compiled into a
    binary byte-code. This byte-code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is usually a software-based interpreter.
    The use of compiled byte-code allows the interpreter (the virtual machine) to be small and efficient (and nearly as fast
    as the CPU running native, compiled code).</p>
    <div style="padding-left: 100px;"><img src="./bin/images/img2.png"></div>
    <h3 id="pt9">High-performance:</h3>
    <p>Java code is faster than other High level languages as Java bytecode is "close" to native code. It is still a little bit
    slower than a compiled language (e.g., C++). Java is an interpreted language that is why it is slower than compiled
    languages, e.g., C, C++, etc.</p>
    <h3 id="pt10">Distributed:</h3>
    <p>Java is distributed because it facilitates users to create distributed applications in Java. Many systems allow us to
    run the code remotely written in a domain-specific language, and Java distributes the code that gets easily compatible
    with the programming environment. RMI and EJB are used for creating distributed applications. This feature of Java makes
    us able to access files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet.</p>
    <h3 id="pt11">Multi-threaded:</h3>
    <p>A thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently. We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at
    once by defining multiple threads.
    Java is a multi-threaded programming language which means we can develop multi-threaded program using Java. A
    multi-threaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently and each part can handle a different task at
    the same time making optimal use of the available resources specially when your computer has multiple CPUs.</p>
    <div style="padding-left: 100px;"><img src="./bin/images/img3.png" height="300px"></div>
    <h3 id="pt12">Dynamic:</h3>
    <p>Java is a dynamic programming language. Dynamic loading of class is supported by it, i.e , it supports loading of class
    on demand. It also supports functions from its native languages, i.e., C and C++. Objects and members can be created
    dynamically. Java supports dynamic compilation and automatic memory management (garbage collection).
